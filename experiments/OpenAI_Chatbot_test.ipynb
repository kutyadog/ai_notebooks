Here are some resources to help you and your families cope: <b>Traumatic Events Support</b>: The aftermath of a traumatic event can be as difficult as the event itself. Please consider participating in one of our free 30-minute sessions with a dedicated counselor, available today, Wednesday and Friday of this week. Click <a href=\"https://www.doodle.com/poll/4z9ir9yky5x7iu5u\">here</a> to sign up. These sessions are in addition to the confidential 24/7 EAP hotline for phone counseling and free in-person sessions available to all employees, contractors and their family members. <b>Resources for Civil Unrest</b>: If you tend to process things on your own, here are <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/guidepost-img/uploads/Civil+Unrest+Resources.pdf\">resources</a> on how to stay safe during civil unrest, deal with a traumatic event, and help children cope with violence and disasters. <b>Virtual Mental Health Services</b>: The Post will pay for virtual mental health services through the end of this year for Aetna members. We will cover 100 percent of the cost for in-network providers and reimburse employees using out-of-network providers at $80/session. (These services are already free for Kaiser members. <b>Teladoc Mental Health Services</b>: Effective July 1, 2020, Aetna members will be able to use Teledoc not only for medical visits, but for therapy and psychiatry visits as well. Teledoc provides access to a nationwide network of counselors, and you will be able to work with the same counselor for the duration of your treatment. The cost of visits are comparable to the costs of Aetna’s network therapists (for therapists with an M.D. degree: $160 initial visit, $90 per session thereafter; for those without an M.D. degree: $80 per session). As described in item 3 above, The Post will pay these costs through the end of this year. <b>Virtual Summer Camp Discount</b>: To help juggle work and childcare, we have negotiated a 10 percent discount with one of our partners, HeadFirst, for virtual summer camps. More information about the camps and discount are coming this week, so please check GuidePost. You can review other wellness and mental health resources on <a href=\"https://guidepost.washpost.com/benefits_and_resources/my_benefits/work_life/eap-work-life-benefits\" target=_blank>GuidePost</a>. And if you have questions or suggestions, you’re welcome to reach out to me, Tracy Grant, or Gregg Fernandes anytime. We meet every day to discuss recent events and plan our next steps.
